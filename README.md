dv-tld: Alias *.dv to localhost
===============================

I got tired of having to look up these steps every time I needed a development domain aliased to
localhost.

Usage:
------
```bash
sudo dv-tld
```

Support:
--------

So far, this script only supports macOS 13 with homebrew.  It accomplishes this via `dnsmasq`.
Patches for other configurations would be appreciated.
